# Citra

## Introduction

A collection of OAuth2 providers with the proper endpoint and request information set up.

## Reasoning

To be a standardized javascript or typescript starting point for OAuth2 protocol. This package was inspired by arctic. The main difference with citra is a focus on [interchangability](https://github.com/pilcrowonpaper/arctic/issues/299) and type safety of the providers.

## Avaiable Providers

There are 63 providers available through Citra

Some providers have the tag (HTTPS Required) since the provider will only authorize over secure connections ... include steps for mkcert ...

Some providers had restrictive steps in their signup process that prevented current testing of them. (Untested: Reason)

If any issues occur with a provider please open one so it can be fixed.
