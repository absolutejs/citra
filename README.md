# Citra

## Introduction

A collection of OAuth2 providers with the proper endpoint and request information set up.

## Reasoning

To be a standardized javascript or typescript starting point for OAuth2 protocol. This package was inspired by arctic. The main difference with citra is a focus on [interchangability](https://github.com/pilcrowonpaper/arctic/issues/299) and type safety of the providers.

## Avaiable Providers

Some providers have the tag (HTTPS Required) since the provider will only authorize over secure connections ... include steps for mkcert ...

Some providers were either restricted (Untested: Restricted) or required payment (Untested: Paid) to set up a client so they are not tested.
